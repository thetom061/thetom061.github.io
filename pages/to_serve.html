                <p>The episode begins with Michael Chambers 
                    locked alone in a spartan room with a cot. 
                    A voice offers him a meal, delivered through a 
                    small aperture in the wall, which he grimly refuses.</p>
                <p>The setting changes to several months earlier, on Earth. 
                    The Kanamits, a race of 9-foot-tall (2.7 m) aliens, land on 
                    Earth as the planet is beset by international crises. As the 
                    Secretary-General announces the landing of aliens on Earth to 
                    the worldwide public at a United Nations news conference, one of 
                    them arrives and addresses the assembled delegates and journalists 
                    via telepathy. He announces that his race's motive in coming to 
                    Earth is to provide humanitarian aid by sharing their advanced 
                    technology, including an atomic generator that can provide electric 
                    power for a few dollars, a nitrate fertilizer that can end famine, 
                    and a force field that can be deployed to prevent international 
                    warfare. After answering questions, the Kanamit departs without 
                    comment and leaves a book in the Kanamit language, which leads to 
                    Michael Chambers, a US government cryptographer, being pressed into 
                    service.</p>
                <p>Initially wary of an alien race who came "quite uninvited", international 
                    leaders begin to be persuaded of the Kanamits' benevolence when their advanced 
                    technology puts an end to hunger, energy shortages, and the arms race. Trust in 
                    the Kanamits seems to be justified when Patty, a member of the cryptography staff 
                    led by Chambers, decodes the title of the Kanamit book: To Serve Man. The Kanamits 
                    submit to interrogation and polygraph, at the request of the UN delegates. When 
                    declaring their benevolent intentions, the polygraph indicates that the Kanamit is 
                    speaking the truth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soon, humans are volunteering for trips to the Kanamits' home planet, which they 
                    describe as a paradise. Kanamits now have embassies in every major city on Earth.
                     With the U.S. Armed Forces having been disbanded and world peace having been achieved, 
                     the code-breaking staff has no real work to do, but Patty is still trying to work out 
                     the meaning of the text of To Serve Man.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The day arrives for Chambers's excursion to the Kanamits' planet. Just as he mounts the 
                    spaceship's boarding stairs, Patty runs toward him in great agitation. While being held back 
                    by a Kanamit guard, Patty cries: "Mr. Chambers, don't get on that ship! The rest of the book To Serve Man, 
                    it's... it's a cookbook!" Chambers tries to run back down the stairs, but a Kanamit blocks him, 
                    the stairs retract, and the ship lifts off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chambers is in the shipboard room now, and is again offered a meal. He throws it to the floor, 
                    but a Kanamit retrieves it and encourages him to eat, to keep Chambers from "losing weight". At last
                     Chambers says to the audience: "How about you? You still on Earth, or on the ship with me? Really doesn't
                      make very much difference, because sooner or later, all of us will be on the menu... all of us." The episode 
                      closes as Chambers gives in and breaks his hunger strike.
