                Henry Bemis (Meredith) works at his window in a bank, while 
                reading David Copperfield, which causes him to shortchange an 
                annoyed customer. Bemis's angry boss (Taylor), and later his 
                nagging wife (deWit), both complain to him that he wastes far 
                too much time reading "doggerel". As a cruel joke, his wife 
                asks him to read poetry from one of his books to her; he eagerly 
                obliges, only to find that she has inked over the text on every 
                page, obscuring the words. Seconds later, she destroys the book 
                by ripping the pages from it, much to Henry's dismay.
                The next day, as usual, Henry takes his lunch break in the bank's 
                vault, where his reading will not be disturbed. Moments after he 
                sees a newspaper headline, which reads "H-Bomb Capable of Total 
                Destruction", an enormous explosion outside the bank violently 
                shakes the vault, knocking Bemis unconscious. After regaining 
                consciousness and recovering the thick glasses required for him 
                to see, Bemis emerges from the vault to find the bank demolished 
                and everyone in it dead. Leaving the bank, he sees that the entire 
                city has been destroyed, and realizes that a nuclear war has 
                devastated Earth, but that his being in the vault has saved him.

                Finding himself totally alone in a shattered world with canned 
                food to last him a lifetime (but no one to share it with) and no 
                means of leaving to look for other survivors, Bemis succumbs to 
                despair. As he prepares to commit suicide using a revolver he has 
                found, Bemis sees the ruins of the public library in the distance. 
                Investigating, he finds that the books are still intact and legible; 
                all the books he could ever hope for are his for the reading, and 
                (as he gazes upon a huge fallen face of a clock) realizes that he 
                has all the time in the world to read them without interruption.
                His despair gone, Bemis contentedly sorts the books he looks forward 
                to reading for years to come, with no obligations to get in the way. 
                Just as he bends down to pick up the first book, he stumbles, and 
                his glasses fall off and shatter. In shock, he picks up the broken 
                remains of the glasses he is virtually blind without, and says, 
                "That's not fair. That's not fair at all. There was time now. There
                 was—was all the time I needed…! It's not fair! It's not fair!" and 
                 bursts into tears, surrounded by books he now can never read.
