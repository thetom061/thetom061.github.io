                Rodman Edward Serling (December 25, 1924 – June 28, 1975) was 
                an American screenwriter, playwright, television producer, and narrator
                known for his live television dramas of the 1950s and his science-fiction 
                anthology TV series, The Twilight Zone. Serling was active in politics, both
                 on and off the screen, and helped form television industry standards. He was 
                 known as the "angry young man" of Hollywood, clashing with television executives 
                 and sponsors over a wide range of issues including censorship, racism, and war.

               <p> On October 2, 1959, the classic Twilight Zone series, created by Serling, premiered on CBS.
                For this series, Serling fought hard to get and maintain creative control. He hired 
                scriptwriters he respected, such as Richard Matheson and Charles Beaumont. In an interview, 
                Serling said the show's science fiction format would not be controversial with sponsors, 
                network executives or the general public and would escape censorship, unlike the earlier script for Playhouse 90.</p>

                <p>Serling drew on his own experience for many episodes, frequently about boxing, military life, and airplane pilots. 
                    The Twilight Zone incorporated his social views on racial relations, somewhat veiled in the science fiction and 
                    fantasy elements of the shows. Occasionally, the point was quite blunt, such as in the episode "I Am the Night—Color 
                    Me Black", in which racism and hatred causes a dark cloud to form in the American South and spread across the world. 
                    Many Twilight Zone stories reflected his views on gender roles, featuring quick-thinking, resilient women as well as 
                    shrewish, nagging wives. This is very visible as he was also the show's narrators and would appear himself in episodes.</p>

                <p>The Twilight Zone aired for five seasons (the first three presented half-hour episodes, the fourth had hour-long episodes, 
                    and the fifth returned to the half-hour format). It won many TV and drama awards and drew critical acclaim for Serling 
                    and his co-workers. Though it had loyal fans, The Twilight Zone had only moderate ratings and was twice canceled and revived. 
                    After five years and 156 episodes (92 written by Serling), he grew weary of the series. In 1964, he decided not to oppose its 
                    third and final cancellation.</p>
                    <p>
                    Serling sold the rights to The Twilight Zone to CBS. His wife later claimed he did this partly because he believed that 
                    his own production company, Cayuga Productions, would never recoup the production costs of the programs, which frequently went
                     over budget.
                    The Twilight Zone eventually resurfaced in the form of a 1983 film by Warner Bros. Former Twilight Zone actor Burgess Meredith
                     was cast as the film's narrator but does not appear on screen. There have been three attempts to revive the TV series with mostly
                      new scripts. In 1985, CBS used Charles Aidman (and later Robin Ward) as the narrator. In 2002, UPN featured Forest Whitaker in the
                       role of narrator. In 2019, CBS made a third attempt at a successful revival, with Jordan Peele taking on producing duties as well 
                       as being host and narrator.</p>
